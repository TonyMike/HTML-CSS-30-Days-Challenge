                        The desire to be respected by someone of the opposite
                         sex is something that runs deep within everyone,
                        even though most people don't take time to find 
                        someone who truly respects them. It seems like people are
                        just looking for someone to show them the slightest
                         amount if attention, setting much less than respect.
                        I am convinced one of the best ways to help any 
                        relationship grow is by showing respect. <br><br>
                        I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to 
                        be respected. what is respect? Respect is showing 
                        showing someone extra special attention, or high 
                        regard, based on a desire to show them how highly they are valued.
